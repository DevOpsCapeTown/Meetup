# Organising a meetup

## Step one

- Find a willing speaker who is prepared to talk
- Confirm the date with venue (Cobus) and speaker

## Step two

- Create a meetup.com event, and save it as draft
- Ask the speaker for bio, abstract, Twitter, GitHub
- Contact sponsors and find out if they are willing to sponsor

## Step three

- Fill in the speakers details on meetup.com and update the website
- Announce the meetup (more than a week before)

## Step four

- Ask #asktheadmins in Zatech to announce the meetup
